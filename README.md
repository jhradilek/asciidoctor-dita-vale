# AsciiDocDITA

**AsciiDocDITA** is a style package for [Vale](https://vale.sh/) that allows you to validate your AsciiDoc content and identify markup that does not have a direct equivalent in DITA 1.3.

In combination with [asciidoctor-dita-topic](https://github.com/jhradilek/asciidoctor-dita-topic) and [dita-convert](https://github.com/jhradilek/dita-custom-xslt), this project can be used to rapidly convert AsciiDoc content to DITA:

1.  Identify incompatible markup in the AsciiDoc source file:

    ```console
    $ vale source_file.adoc
    ```
2.  Convert the AsciiDoc file to a generic DITA topic:

    ```console
    $ asciidoctor -r dita-topic -b dita-topic source_file.adoc
    ```
3.  Convert the generic DITA topic to a specialized DITA concept, reference, or task:

    ```console
    $ dita-convert -gt task source_file.dita
    ```

## Installation

1.  Install the latest available version of Vale as described in [the official documentation](https://vale.sh/docs/install).
2.  Create a `.vale.ini` file in the main directory of your AsciiDoc project:

    ```ini
    StylesPath = .vale/styles
    inAlertLevel = suggestion
    Packages = https://github.com/jhradilek/asciidoctor-dita-vale/releases/latest/download/AsciiDocDITA.zip

    [*.adoc]
    BasedOnStyles = AsciiDocDITA

    # Disable selected rules:
    AsciiDocDITA.ShortDescription = NO
    ```
3.  Download and install the `AsciiDocDITA` package:

    ```console
    $ vale sync
    ```

## Usage

*   To validate a single AsciiDoc file, run the following command:

    ```console
    $ vale source_file.adoc
    ```
*   To validate all AsciiDoc files in the current directory and all of its subdirectories, run the following command:

    ```console
    $ vale .
    ```
*   Read the [the official documentation](https://vale.sh/docs/install) to learn how to use Vale in and editor such as VSCode, Neovim, or Emacs, or run it as a GitHub action.
