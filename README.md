# AsciiDocDITA

**AsciiDocDITA** is a style package for [Vale](https://vale.sh/) that allows you to validate your AsciiDoc content and identify markup that does not have a direct equivalent in DITA 1.3.

## Installation

1.  Install the latest available version of Vale as described in [the official documentation](https://vale.sh/docs/install).
2.  Create a `.vale.ini` file in the main directory of your AsciiDoc project:

    ```ini
    StylesPath = .vale/styles
    MinAlertLevel = warning
    Packages = https://github.com/jhradilek/asciidoctor-dita-vale/releases/latest/download/AsciiDocDITA.zip

    [*.adoc]
    BasedOnStyles = AsciiDocDITA
    ```
3.  Download and install the `AsciiDocDITA` package:

    ```console
    $ vale sync
    ```

## Usage

*   To validate a single AsciiDoc file, run the following command:

    ```console
    $ vale source_file.adoc
    ```
*   To validate all AsciiDoc files in the current directory and all of its subdirectories, run the following command:

    ```console
    $ vale .
    ```
*   To list suggestions that are normally diabled by setting the `MinAlertLevel` option to `warning` in the configuration, run the following command:

    ```console
    $ vale --filter '.Level=="suggestion"' .
    ```
*   Read [the official documentation](https://vale.sh/docs/install) to learn how to use Vale in an editor such as VSCode, Neovim, or Emacs, or run it as a GitHub action.
